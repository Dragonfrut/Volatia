# Fighter
You are a fighter, a veteran warrior expertly
trained in weapons and armour. Perhaps you are
a mail clad knight, an agile spearman, or a sharp
eyed bowman. Fighters are versatile masters of all
weapons, switching between armaments and
fighting styles to best meet the foe at hand.

The fighter is the most heavily armed and
armoured adventurer in the game. You are
comfortable in the thick of battle, relying on
brawn, steel and superior skill to win the day.
